1)
	 Distributed are the two hash tables and an integer representing the order
	 number. The hash maps Represent the current ledger, mapping client IDs to
	 their account balances, and the index, mapping stock symbols to a stock
	 class. The stock class contains a buy request list, a sell request list,
	 the stock name, the price, and the shares owned by the company.
2)
	 My program is not byzantine fault-tolerant. To do so we would have to add
	 a voting adapter and perform votes on replicas of data. Currently, we
	 just grab shared state data from one of our peers.
3)
	 It is not scalable. Multicasting messages does not scale well as protocols
	 to do so are slow.
4)
	 I did not use additional distributed locks. All the processes act on their
	 own copies of the data and only share incoming read-only messages. To get
	 shared state they needed only to read from a peer
