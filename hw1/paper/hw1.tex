\title{Topology Management in Peer-to-Peer Systems}
\author{Jorge J.~G\'omez}

\maketitle
\section{Problem Statement}
  Using an algorithm based on the paper~\cite{t-man} by Jelasity and Babaoglu, 
  this assignment asked to simulate a distributed node system managing it's
  topology. The algorithm involves having the nodes trading neighbor lists and
  selecting the closest. The result is that after a certain amount of cycles,
  the topology begins to converge to the optimal.
\section{Approach}
  Following the notes in the assignment, the algorithm was created in Python
  2.7.1.  The nodes where instantiated as objects that had a gossip method in
  which the node would trade neighbor lists with one of its neighbors. The node
  would then select the $k$ closest nodes, where $k$ is an input parameter. The
  node class had other methods for finding the distance to a given node and
  choosing the closest neighbors.  Another class was made to help set up a
  system and simulate it.  More information can be found in the source code
  \texttt{hw1.py}.
\section{Results and Figures}
  The code was written with unit tests to ensure every step of development was
  correct and development proceeded without major issues. Figure~\ref{results}
  shows the plot requested for this assignment.
