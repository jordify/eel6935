### Compiling and running

This assignment was written and tested with Python 2.7.1. There is no
compilation required just run with the command:

`python hw1.pdf -N 1024 -k 3`

Where 1024 and 3 are the N and k inputs. If in place of those last two
arguments one where run:

`python hw1.pdf --help`

The program would output all of the possible command-line flags.
