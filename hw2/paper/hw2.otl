Where to split the program?
	At the function != main
		Gives the client all of the work
		More true to the assignment
		Requires a struct to be passed over rpc
			Unless the -N flag is included apparently
	At the inputs to the simFS program {OPEN, REMOVE, SHOW, FIND, WRITE}
		Each takes as input some newline terminated string
		Returns a string which may have multiple newlines in it
